Project Problem Statement

1. Problem Statement

Traditional manual library management is prone to errors and inefficiencies. Librarians often struggle with tracking physical book stock, managing student records, and calculating overdue returns manually. There is a critical need for a digital solution that automates these core tasks to save time and reduce human error.

2. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a Library Management System using Python.

In Scope:

Digital inventory management of books.

Registration of library members.

Automated checking of stock availability before issuing.

Persistent storage of all transaction data.

Out of Scope:

Payment gateway for fine collection.

Barcode scanning integration.

3. Target Users

University Librarians: To manage the book repository and track assets.

Students & Faculty: To query book availability and maintain their borrowing history.

Administrators: To audit library usage and member activity.

4. High-Level Features

CRUD Operations: Create, Read, and Update operations for both Books and Members.

Transaction Processing: Real-time updates to book quantity during Issue/Return cycles.

Search Capability: Efficient traversal of data to find specific books or members by ID.

Error Handling: Robust handling of missing files or invalid inputs to prevent system crashes.
